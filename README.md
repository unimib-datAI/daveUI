# DAVE: A Framework for Assisted Analysis of Document Collections

## Description

DAVE is an AI-powered framework designed for assisted analysis of document collections in knowledge-intensive domains. It enables domain experts to efficiently explore and analyze large text corpora through a combination of:

- **Entity-driven faceted search** for structured information retrieval
- **Conversational AI interface** for natural language queries
- **Interactive entity annotation and correction** for improved knowledge management

DAVE is particularly useful in domains such as **law, healthcare, finance, and real estate**, where factual data is closely tied to entities and their relationships.

## Features

- **Search & Filter:** Retrieve documents using keyword-based and entity-driven faceted search.
- **Explore:** Navigate documents based on extracted entities and metadata.
- **Conversational AI:** Ask natural language questions and receive relevant document-based answers.
- **Knowledge Consolidation:** Review and refine extracted annotations with user corrections.
- **Human-in-the-loop (HITL) Approach:** Users can continuously refine system-generated annotations.
